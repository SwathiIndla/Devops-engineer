Global Variable Reference
Pipeline also provides a built-in "Global Variable Reference."

The variables provided by default in Pipeline are:

a.env
Exposes environment variables, for example: env.PATH or env.BUILD_ID. Consult the built-in global variable
reference at ${YOUR_JENKINS_URL}/pipeline-syntax/globals#env for a complete, and up to date, list of environment variables available in Pipeline.

b.params
Exposes all parameters defined for the Pipeline as a read-only Map, for example: params.MY_PARAM_NAME.

c.currentBuild
May be used to discover information about the currently executing Pipeline, with properties such as currentBuild.result, currentBuild.displayName, etc. 
Consult the built-in global variable reference at ${YOUR_JENKINS_URL}/pipeline-syntax/globals for a complete, and up to date, list of properties available on currentBuild.
