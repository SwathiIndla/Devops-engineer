Docker is a set of platforms as a service (PaaS) products that use Operating system-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers
Docker is an open-source containerization platform by which you can pack your application and all its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container

WHAT IS DOCKERFILE????
The Dockerfile uses DSL (Domain Specific Language) and contains instructions for generating a Docker image. Dockerfile will define the processes to quickly produce an image.
While creating your application, you should create a Dockerfile in order since the Docker daemon runs all of the instructions from top to bottom.


WHAT IS DOCKER IMAGES???
It is a file, comprised of multiple layers, used to execute code in a Docker container. They are a set of instructions used to create docker containers.
Docker Image is an executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application. This image informs how a container should instantiate,
determining which software components will run and how. Docker Container is a virtual environment 
that bundles application code with all the dependencies required to run the application. The application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

WHAT IS DOCKER CONTAINERS??
Docker container is a runtime instance of an image. Allows developers to package applications with all parts needed such as libraries and other dependencies. Docker Containers 
are runtime instances of Docker images
