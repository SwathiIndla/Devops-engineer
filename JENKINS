INSTALLATION OF JENKINS ON VM
sudo yum install epel-release -y
sudo yum install java-11-openjdk -y -- JAVA prereqisites
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo --no-check-certificate
sudo rpm --import http://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
sudo yum install jenkins -y
Edit /lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service file and change Jenkins port to 8090 by updating Environment="JENKINS_PORT=" variable value.
sudo vi /lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service
It should look like this:
Environment="JENKINS_PORT=8090"
Once done start Jenkins service.
sudo systemctl restart jenkins


INSTALLATION OF JAVA
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-17-jre
java -version
openjdk version "17.0.8" 2023-07-18
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.8+7-Debian-1deb12u1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.8+7-Debian-1deb12u1, mixed mode, sharing)




Long Term Support release
A LTS (Long-Term Support) release is chosen every 12 weeks from the stream of regular releases as the stable release for that time period. It can be installed from the debian-stable apt repository.

sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
Weekly release
A new release is produced weekly to deliver bug fixes and features to users and plugin developers. It can be installed from the debian apt repository.

Beginning with Jenkins 2.335 and Jenkins 2.332.1, the package is configured with systemd rather than the older System V init. See the DigitalOcean community systemd tutorial to better understand the benefits of systemd and the systemctl command.

The package installation will:

Setup Jenkins as a daemon launched on start. Run systemctl cat jenkins for more details.

Create a ‘jenkins’ user to run this service.

Direct console log output to systemd-journald. Run journalctl -u jenkins.service if you are troubleshooting Jenkins.

Populate /lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service with configuration parameters for the launch, e.g JENKINS_HOME

Set Jenkins to listen on port 8080. Access this port with your browser to start configuration.

If Jenkins fails to start because a port is in use, run systemctl edit jenkins and add the following:

[Service]
Environment="JENKINS_PORT=8081"
Here, "8081" was chosen but you can put another port available.

Installation of Java
Jenkins requires Java to run, yet not all Linux distributions include Java by default. Additionally, not all Java versions are compatible with Jenkins.

There are multiple Java implementations which you can use. OpenJDK is the most popular one at the moment, we will use it in this guide.

Update the Debian apt repositories, install OpenJDK 17, and check the installation with the commands:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-17-jre
java -version
openjdk version "17.0.8" 2023-07-18
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.8+7-Debian-1deb12u1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.8+7-Debian-1deb12u1, mixed mode, sharing)

INTERACTING JENKINS THROUGH CLI:
 1.firstly install jenkins-cli.jar  by runnning -- wget http://20.64.224.10:8080/jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar
 2. authentication of jenkins using ---java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://20.64.224.10:8080/  -auth username:apitoken (username>mange>api token)
